# IdiomReplaceX Browser App

The IdiomReplaceX Browser App is a special browser app from the net art project IdiomReplaceX.
An art project founded as contribution to the UNESCO City of Media Arts Karlsruhe
(https://www.cityofmediaarts.de).

When using this browser, the IdiomReplaceX toolbox is added to almost any web page,
allowing literary filters to be applied to the content of the web page.
For further information on the net art project IdiomReplaceX please see https://idiomreplacex.de/.

The IdiomReplaceX Browser App is based on the excellent 
[Flutter Browser App](https://github.com/pichillilorenzo/flutter_browser_app). We are very grateful
for this open source project, without which developing the IdiomReplaceX Browser App would have
been a much greater effort.
