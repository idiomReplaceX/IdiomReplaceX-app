# IdiomReplaceX Browser App

The IdiomReplaceX Browser App is a special browser app from the net art project IdiomReplaceX. 
When using this browser, the IdiomReplaceX toolbox is added to almost any web page, allowing 
literary filters to be applied to the content of the web page.
For further information on the net art project IdiomReplaceX please see https://idiomreplacex.de/".

The IdiomReplaceX Browser App is based on the excellent **[Flutter Browser App](https://github.com/pichillilorenzo/flutter_browser_app)**

We are very grateful for this open source project, without which developing the IdiomReplaceX Browser App 
would have bee a much greater effort. A Full-Featured Mobile Browser App (such as the Google Chrome mobile browser) created using Flutter and the features offered by the [flutter_inappwebview](https://github.com/pichillilorenzo/flutter_inappwebview) plugin.

It will soon be available on the **Google Play Store** at [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=...](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=...)
